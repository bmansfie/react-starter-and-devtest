Just noticed the intent to log time via GIT checkins.  Sorry I didn't catch that earlier.

I did put some thought into the frame work I picked.  I wanted something up to date with the state
of things, something that could be used for the next 2 years without feeling deprecated.  I wanted
an environment that took care of the bulk of the heavy lifting in setting up a system for me.
So I started with https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit .  I forked it and started from there.

Understand that my base react knowledge was limited, I've half way through a couple of tutorials but
that's it.  Also, there were a lot of packages in this kit that I've never used before.  Which is
largely reflected in the startup time.

Time consumption:

7 hours: Getting the initial framework up and running took a crazy amount of time, and then
working through the learning curve to understand the naunces of the router, the css isolation, and
other bits of the react starter kit took me a bit of time.  I way underestimated the effort
involved on this step :)

4 hours: Article page.
2.5 hours: Masonry page.
1.75 hours: Tile page.
45 minutes: Tiles page.
45 minutes: misc touchups.

At this point I'm considering some architectural decisions I made and how I might rework things to
let things be a little more data driven and less static.  I could play with component
identification and rendering, but the details of the layouts might be poor with this approach.
So, currently, it is what it is.
