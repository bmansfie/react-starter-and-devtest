Just noticed the intent to log time via GIT checkins.  Sorry I didn't catch that earlier.

Getting the initial framework up and running took a crazy amount of time, and then
working through the learning curve to understand the naunces of the router, the css isolation, and
other bits of the react starter kit took me a bit of time.  I'm estimating about 6-7 hours to get it
all running smoothly.  I way underestimated the effort involved on this step :)

Subsequently the Article page took me about 3.5 hours to make all the components and tweak it to run
correctly.

The masonry page has taken 2.5 hours to complete.
