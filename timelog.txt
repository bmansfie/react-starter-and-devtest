Just noticed the intent to log time via GIT checkins.  Sorry I didn't catch that earlier.

Time consumption:

7 hours: Getting the initial framework up and running took a crazy amount of time, and then
working through the learning curve to understand the naunces of the router, the css isolation, and
other bits of the react starter kit took me a bit of time.  I way underestimated the effort
involved on this step :)

4 hours: Article page.
2.5 hours: Masonry page.
1.75 hours: Tile page.
45 minutes: Tiles page.
45 minutes: misc touchups.
